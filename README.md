## 5. AI/ML Demand Forecasting Approach

### 5.1 Data Inputs
- **Historical Consumption:** Dispense and receipt transactions per facility/medicine.
- **Stock Levels & Stock-outs:** Opening/closing balances, days of stock-out.
- **Demographics & Disease Burden:** Population, incidence of key diseases per region.
- **Seasonality Factors:** Weather data, health campaign schedules.
- **Supply Chain Metadata:** Lead times, supplier reliability, order fill rates.

### 5.2 Model Strategy
- **Baseline:** Time-series forecasting (Prophet/SARIMA) per medicine-facility pair.
- **Advanced Models:** Gradient boosted models (XGBoost, LightGBM) or Temporal Fusion Transformers for complex temporal dependencies using PyTorch Forecasting.
- **Cold Start Handling:** Regional clustering, meta-learning with facility characteristics.
- **Model Training:** Rolling-origin cross-validation with multi-step horizon.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Forecast Bias, Service Level (stock-out rate reduction).

### 5.3 Model Serving & Monitoring

## 7. Data Security & Privacy Strategy

- **Compliance Frameworks:**
  - Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR).
  - HIPAA-inspired safeguards (administrative, physical, technical).
  - WHO guidelines for digital health data.
- **Security Measures:**
  - End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.2+ for transit; AES-256 for rest via open-source KMS solutions like HashiCorp Vault).
  - Role-based access with least privilege enforced via Django permissions and Keycloak integration if scaled.
  - Regular vulnerability scanning using open-source tools (OWASP ZAP, OpenVAS).
  - Audit trails with immutable logs stored in Elasticsearch/OpenSearch.
- **Data Privacy:**
  - De-identification of patient-level data if collected; prefer aggregate metrics.
  - Consent management for facilities sharing data.
  - Data residency compliance by hosting in African data centers (AWS Cape Town, Azure South Africa, or local providers).
- **Disaster Recovery:**
  - Automated backups, multi-region replication, RPO/RTO targets < 1 hour for critical services.
- **Policy & Governance:**
  - Appoint Data Protection Officer.
  - Incident response plan and breach notification procedure.
  - Periodic training for staff on data handling.

## 8. Scalability, Performance & Offline Considerations

- **Scalability:**
  - Modular Django apps with clear bounded contexts; scale horizontally using Gunicorn + Nginx.
  - Database read replicas and partitioning for large datasets.
  - CDN (Cloudflare free tier) for static content delivery.
- **Performance:**
  - Caching frequently accessed dashboards (Redis, Django cache framework).
  - Asynchronous processing for heavy tasks via Celery workers.
  - API rate limiting with Django REST throttling to ensure stability.
- **Offline Support:**
  - Mobile app stores transactions locally (SQLite) with background sync when connectivity resumes.
  - Conflict resolution rules (last-write-wins with manual review logs).
  - SMS/USSD fallback for critical alerts in low-bandwidth regions leveraging free/low-cost gateways during pilot.
- **Monitoring & Reliability:**
  - SLIs/SLOs for API latency, uptime (target 99.5%+).
  - Synthetic monitoring of key flows (login, data sync) using open-source tools like k6 or Selenium Grid.
  - Circuit breakers on integration services using library patterns (Hystrix-like in Python).

## 12. Implementation Kickoff

The repository now includes starter code for the Django REST Framework backend (`backend/`) and the Vite + React TypeScript frontend (`frontend/`).

### 12.1 Backend Setup
1. `cd backend`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Copy environment defaults: `cp .env.example .env`
5. Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
6. Create a superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
7. Run the API locally: `python manage.py runserver`

Key API endpoints:
- `GET /api/health/` â€“ Health check used by the frontend probe.
- `api/v1/accounts/` â€“ Admin-only CRUD for users.
- `api/v1/inventory/` â€“ CRUD endpoints for facilities, medicines, transactions, forecasts, alerts, and integration configs.

### 12.2 Frontend Setup
1. `cd frontend`
2. Install dependencies (Node 18+ recommended): `npm install`
3. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Access the app via `http://localhost:5173`

The landing screen pings the Django health endpoint to confirm connectivity and will evolve into role-specific dashboards as APIs mature.

### 12.3 Next Engineering Tasks
- Implement authentication flows (token-based sessions, password resets, MFA hooks).
- Harden API permissions with granular DRF policies per role.
- Add integration workers (Celery + Redis) for DHIS2/OpenLMIS data ingestion.
- Scaffold forecasting pipelines (batch jobs, model registry, monitoring).
- Flesh out frontend routing and shared component library.
